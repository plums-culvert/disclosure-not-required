            <p>In three visits to the area surrounding Skinwalker Ranch, I've had five sightings. Every time I go, I see something. Is it just a coincidence? Maybe it's just private aircraft or military testing. But if so, why there? Why are the objects seen here uncharacteristic of standard aircraft? Of all places, why Roosevelt, Utah?</p>
            <p>What is it that makes this area such a hotspot of activity? Could it be something hidden in the ground? Something in the sky? Or is it a combination of both and something else entirely?</p>
            <p>What if there's no need for government disclosure because it's right in front of us? All you need to do is visit the area surrounding Skinwalker Ranch with good intentions and open eyes.</p>

            <p>Driving south on 4500 E in Roosevelt, Utah, at 9:31 PM, I observed a bright orange light, about the size of the moon, brightness of the sun at sunset without being a source of light to the environment, and with soft edges.</p>
            <p>It appeared approximately 5,000 feet away or less, moving east. When it moved behind a cloud, it disappeared, without illuminating the cloud.</p>
            <p>The event was captured on video, where the object appears in the sky moving steadily, illuminating seemingly out of the atmosphere or like a light turning on.</p>
            <p>Inspection of the video shows that the object appears elongated like a cigar or disc.</p>
            <p>Flight tracking data showed no aircraft in the vicinity of the sighting.</p>

            <p>I was parked on E 4000 S, about center-ranch as I was observing the mesa. A bright, slow-moving orb appeared, brighter than any star in the sky and 
                early enough that the stars were not visible yet on the horizon. The object moved slowly northward for minutes before fading into the distance.</p>
            <p>It was captured on video, and upon frame-by-frame inspection, the object appears to change color and shape from an amorphous light to the appearance of 
                "wheels within wheels."</p>
            <p>Flight tracking data showed no aircraft in the vicinity of the sighting.</p>

            <p>Shortly after the second sighting another object appeared that flashed. Every three seconds the object would flash, pause for about eight seconds, and then flash again.</p>
            <p>The object appeared in the north, passed overhead, slightly eastward, heading south. After a minute or so I lost sight of it when it flew behind me toward the bright, rising moon on the horizon.</p>
            <p>Flight tracking data showed no aircraft in the vicinity of the sighting.</p>

            <p>Almost immediately after arriving at a destination along E 4000 S, a bright, fast-moving light was spotted in the east, moving south, and after a minute, it made a sharp U-turn and headed north before fading into the distance.</p>

            <p>After arriving and shortly after seeing the u-turning object described above, a small, dim orb appeared over the mesa. It was small and faint, and hovered, moving slowly.</p>
